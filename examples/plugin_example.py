"""Example custom extractor plugin for tg-streaming-bot.

Copy this file into your plugin directory (the ``./plugins`` folder mounted into
the Docker container, or the directory named by the ``PLUGIN_DIR`` env var),
rename it, and edit it for the site you want to support. Do NOT leave this
example in the plugin dir — its match() never fires, but keep the dir tidy.

A plugin is a ``.py`` file exposing two module-level callables:

    match(url)   -> bool          : claim the URLs you handle
    resolve(url) -> media source  : turn the page URL into a media URL ffmpeg can
                                    download, or None to fall through

resolve() may be sync or async and may return:
    * a media URL string,
    * a (media_url, referer) tuple,
    * a ResolveResult(media_url, referer=..., headers={...}), or
    * None.

The returned media URL is streamed by ffmpeg directly, with the referer/headers
sent on every request. A plugin that raises is logged and skipped — it can
never break playback.
